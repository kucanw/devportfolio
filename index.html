                    <p>
                   I am 19 years old Unity game developer from Zagreb, Croatia. I've finished high school as a Computer technician and I have a background in coding and robotics.
		   I've attended multiple competitions in robotics in high school and won first place in one of the competitions. I am very dedicated and I love learning new skills and expanding my knowledge in coding and other fields. My goal is to learn as much as possible so I can have a successful career. I would love to travel the world and explore my other passions. My current hobbies are gym, gaming and traveling.

			Also using AR I made some QR codes/specific image readers. When the phone camera detects QR code or specific image

                        <p>
                       	I came up with this game idea after I found a great asset that had the animation for sword combat. I made the whole level
			and the atmosphere, my main focus was on learning how to implement a good atmosphere and graphics. Combat is simple and
			straightforward. In this project I would say that I learned ins and out of Unity animation system, now I have no problems
			with implementing animations.
